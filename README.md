#### Quick II is a visual programming tool designed for programmable logic controllers (PLCs). It allows users to create control logic using graphical blocks, such as logical operators (AND, OR, NOT), timers, counters, and triggers. With its intuitive drag-and-drop interface, Quick II simplifies the process of developing and debugging control systems without requiring deep programming knowledge. Ideal for automation tasks in industries like manufacturing, building management, and other automated environments.

Each file performs a different task.

Traffic lights 1.fab - an oversimplified example of how a traffic light works. It implements automatic sequential switching of light from red to yellow, from yellow to green, from green to yellow, from yellow to red, etc.
